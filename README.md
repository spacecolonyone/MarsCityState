The following is a design of an envisioned city on Mars. It describes a pioneering large settlement in space - one that should be possible to build already in 21st century. Its design focuses on characteristics that will make it practical, vital and sustainable. As such, the design of this city will greatly differ from possible designs of future cities created after mankind has well established its presence in space.

```
diagram of 4 characteristics, 3 players, 4 milestones and 3 phases
```

The design of the city is based on four key characteristics:
 * **Economic attractiveness** - while the Earth in 21st century is seeing the limit to its population and fierce competition over natural resources, the city on Mars will offer businesses healthy economic growth through access to **fast-growing population** and **untapped resources**
 * **Development roadmap** - the **identity of the city** will evolve around a sequence of **major milestones** in its development - building the first space elevator and the first industrial factory in space - attracting the right residents to support it
 * **Service platform** - the city will provide a platform for services for the needs of its residents and businesses. It will make it easy for businesses to quickly start and **scale** their operations. It will also enforce **regulation** over all services to ensure they are safe to be consumed by the residents
 * **Modular infrastructure** - the infrastructure provides basis for the logistics in the city through an assembly of **standardized modules**. The blocks are easy to replace when damaged and easy to relocate when the city needs to **adapt and evolve**

and the interaction of three key participating groups:
 * **Governor**
 * **Residents**
 * **Service companies**

# Economic attractiveness

The first city on Mars and its design will be shaped by the forces that lead humans settle on the planet. This design assumes the major force to be economics and we will start its description by looking at the projections of the relevant drivers of world economy in the near future.

## Natural resources and population growth on Earth

The world has experienced exponential economic growth in the last decades with advances in technology and high standard of living. Despite the many threads to the economy (like financial crises, climate changes, depleting natural resources, social inequalities, etc.) businesses and consumers are used to this growth and are expecting it to continue. The econimic growth, as measured by world GDP per capita, is projected to continue to grow but any analyses on the future of economy describes the increased effort required to maintain this growth, partially due to the effects of over-population. The increasing population on Earth and its increasingly demanding way of living will burden the access to the limited sources of energy, water and food.

Cost of living will increase in the following decades and will contribute to the slow down of the growth rate of world population. Projections show that by year 2100 the growth rate of human population will get back to that of year 1900.
![absolute-increase-global-population](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/82130786-420afa80-97d7-11ea-9bf4-cb0c67c5521a.png)
(Source: https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)

Since population growth is a key driver of economic growth, the limited growth of population will also limit the economic growth on Earth. The world economy will bear the characteristics of a saturated market with high competition for the same base of consumers resulting into limited profitability and limited growth potential for the businesses.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Natural resources and population growth on Mars

While the economy on Earth will face over-population and saturated markets, the economy on Mars will have different challenges and opportunities. Mars is neither populated, nor developed. However, it has huge potential in land to populate, natural resources to extract and better access to Space and its resources. The major barriers to untapping this potential for population and natural resources can be removed with advances in technology, which history shows follow Moore's law. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that our abilities to expand our economy on Mars will grow exponentially, doubling every few years or decades.

Founding a city on Mars with even mediocre standard of living will unlock population growth rate similar to that of average Earth cities. Our proposed design will aim for relatively good standard of living with growth rate following the fours milestones of development of the city:

 * Annual growth rate of 20% from 2030 to 2050 with science and tourism as main source of income. The population will grow from 10 to 1000 residents
 * Annual growth rate of 10% from 2050 to 2100 with real-estate and services as main source of income. The population will grow from 1K to 100K residents
 * Annual growth rate of 5% from 2100 to 2150 with industrial as main source of income. The population will grow from 100K to 1M residents
 
![mars-population](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/82145313-9a331280-9852-11ea-80ac-4ef901ceb4b4.png)

As a result the first city, or network of cities, will reach a population of 1 million by year 2150. This population will participate in the economy and will, by itself, attract businesses.

Natural resources on the surface of Mars and in space near the planet will also become easier to harvest. Although in the beginning heavy machinery will be expensive to transport to the planet, advances in technology - lighter materials and cheaper transportation - will gradually lower the costs for opening and operating resources extraction sites. In constrast, on Earth the cost of running similar sites will continue to grow due to competition over resources and environmental concerns, for example pollution.

In addition, the gravity of Mars is only about 38% of that of Earth and it is situated 50% closer to the edge of the asteroid belt which makes it a better candidate than Earth for becoming an asteroid mining hub.

We can conclude that there will be a great contrast in the following century between Earth and Mars considering population growth and access to natural resources. Population growth on Earth will slow down, while that on Mars will grow exponentially. Access to natural resources on Earth will slow down, while that on Mars will grow exponentially. This conclusion suggests Mars will at a given point in time become an interesting investment opportunity and earlier investors will gain advantage over laggers.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Economic development of a city on Mars

The design of the city proposed here will follow an interesting path of economic development. According to the three-sector model of economics the main focus of societies will shift from the primary sector (extraction of raw materials) through the secondary sector (manufacturing) to the tertiary sector (services). The model classifies intellectual activities and knowledge based activities in the quaternary sector as an extension to the model.

The city on Mars will, however, follow a reversed path by starting almost entirely in the quaternary and tertiary sectors. Within the first few decades after its foundation its main livelihood and source of income will be from exporting science and tourism. Only after the first milestone of building the first space elevetor it will become sufficiently affordable for various businesses and individuals to self-fund their journey to Mars and the critical mass of residents and services will reach the point for the tertiary sector to dominate the economic activities. Later, after the second milestone of building the first industrial factory in space, the secondary sector will gain momentum as the city will be capable of producing a rich variety of goods. Finally, the city will build the needed industrial power to develop extraction sites sufficient to become net exporter of raw materials.

The share of economic sectors in time will evolve in this way:
![economy-sectors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/82159640-5236de80-9898-11ea-8b17-e51e0e6d4dd6.png)

The design of the city on Mars deliberately supports this path of economic evolution and the city founder will have the responsibility to maintain it because it will ensure that GDP per capita for the city will start reltively high and will remain high, which will be an important factor for attracting businesses and residents.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Return on investment for the city founder

The city will be driven by three groups - the governor, residents and businesses. The city founder will possibly be the first governor to run the city. They will have a few responsibilities that we will describe further and among those there will be the responsibility to maintain the economical viability of the city. This will include building the city by the design and managing the different phases, most importantly the first phase "Science and tourism" which will require a lot of financial investment and entrepreneurial skills until the city gains momentum to transition into the next phase.

The city founder will need to either provide or contract:
 * Pipeline of science projects - for revenue
 * Pipeline of tourists - for revenue
 * The minimum services - shelter, air, water, food and waste, energy and heating, communication - through the service platform described later - for supporting the science and tourism activities

The following calculation presents the scenario where the city founder . It spreads all investments starting from a 10-year period before the city is founded. Capital and operating expenses are split in categories reseaarh and deveopment (R&D), production, transport, aintenance and operations with the following assumptions:
 * Research and development activities start in 2020 (or 10 years before the planned date of city founding)
 * The population starts with 10 residents in 2030 and grows to 1000 residents in 2050
 * The city founder provides the six life support services - the set of minimum services in the service platform
 * Yearly spending of 200 million USD per service per year for research and development
 * Service equipment is produced on Earth with progressively increased capacity amounting to 120% of actual population in the city
 * Cost of service equipment starts at 50 million USD per resident per service and is reduced by 10% per year from research and development output
 * Weight of service equipment is 10 000 kg per resident and is transported to Mars at 500 USD per kg
 * Yearly maintenance expenses of service equipment is 20% of its production cost
 * Yearly operating expenses and supplies of service equipment is 100 000 USD per resident per service
 * Scientists in city are 20% of population
 * 3 active projects per scientist per year
 * Yearly revenue of 25 million USD per active scientific project
 * Tourists in city are 20% of population
 * Revenue of one tourist year starts at 25 million USD in 2030 and falls by 20% year-by-year

![cash-flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/82259422-36007380-9964-11ea-8ff7-f6e01d332912.png)

This high-level calculations show that the city founder will reach positive cash flow around year 2045 and will break even 10 years later. Net expenses top at 4 billion USD per year which could be a manageable joint investment by a group of a dozen interested large enterprises that wish to take the first mover advantage in a new Mars economy.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Development roadmap
The design of the city will follow a roadmap of four major milestones that mark three distinctive periods of economic development:

![roadmap-phases-milestones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/82374055-30b82d00-9a27-11ea-97f4-d09a86cb05e3.png)

 * City founded milestone - The city will be founded as a small colony with 10 residents
 * Science and tourism phase - The period starting when the city is founded. In this period the population will grow to 1 thousand residents. The city will develop unique opportunities for scientists and tourists to support its growth
 * First space elevator milestone - The city will build its first space elevator as a highway between the surface of the planet and outer space
 * Real estate phase - The period after the space elevator is operational. In this period the polulation will grow to 100 thousand residents. The city will develop real estate and services market attracting people to its unique lifestyle
 * First industrial factory milestone - The city will build an industrial zone in orbit using its access to space and the planet with the network of space elevators
 * Industrial phase - The period after the industrial factory in space becomes operational. In this period the population will grow to 1 million. The city will specialize in production exploiting the characteristics of space and will support its growth through exports
 * Population of 1 million milestone - The city will become a true city of human civilization with unique cultural, social, economic, political footprint

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2030: City founded. Science and tourism phase
The city is founded in around 2030 with the infrastructure and staff to support scientists and tourists

![milestone-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925239-c18bd900-8d96-11ea-809f-1862df0036ea.png)

The city will gradually attract more scientists and tourists and re-invest the income in scaling the infrastructure and staff, with 8:2 ratio of staff to scientists/tourists, until it reaches population of 1 thousand

```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2050: First Space elevator. Real-estate phase
The city will build its first space elevator in around 2050.

![milestone-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925241-c2bd0600-8d96-11ea-8f41-4438bb606af3.png)

The elevator will be in its own right a "wonder of the world" with great economic and social impact. It will mark a turning point for the city by offering more affordable way for people to maintain their desired standard of living on Mars as compared to the Earth. The number of people self-funding their migration to the city will for the first time exceed the number of residents hired to support the scientists and tourists

```
Real-estate phase
Years: from 2050 to 2100
Population: from 1K to 100K

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2100: First industrial factory in space. Industrial phase
The city will build its first industrial factory in space in around 2100.

![milestone-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925235-bd5fbb80-8d96-11ea-87cb-a1a8ce36ce03.png)

The factory will have strong competitive advantages over the industrial sites on the Earth in producing certain products by exploiting the vacuum of space, zero gravity, less risk of polution.

```
Industrial phase
Years: from 2100 to 2150
Population: from 100K to 1M
Population growth rate: 5%
Attractiveness: Prospering industrial zone

The role of governor, citizens, service companies. The point of view of governor, citizens, service companies

At this point the city will have advantage over the Earth in building a large industrial complex in space. This industrial complex will have unique possibilities for supporting special technologies and developing economies. For example, it will have easier access to asteroid-mined resources, will be able to use technologies relying on zero-gravity or vacuum, will be less exposed to risks of polution, etc.
The city will use its space elevator to build the complex at a lower cost for transportation and construction as compared to Earth competition. The complex will be robotized and controlled from Mars surface.
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2150: Population of 1 million
The city will maintain average yearly growth of 4-5% to reach a population of 1 million by around 2150.

![milestone-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925238-bfc21580-8d96-11ea-9972-8bed55533ed6.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Service platform

The city growth is driven by the interaction of three groups:

```
diagram of Governor, Service companies, Residents
- life support - with minimum set of services
- politics, culture, economy, ... - participates in the "global" (now interplanetary) system but will quickly build own style and add to diversity of human civilization. Large set of services. Good standard of living. It will become a great place to live in
```

A government or private entity will found the city. People will then move into the city to live and work in. Service companies will also move into the city to continue developing it.

Diagram:
 - Citizens pays Governor for housing. Governor gives regulation of services.
 - Service companies give services to citizens. Service companies receive subscription fees from citizens.
 - Service companies give tax to governor. Governor gives service platform and access to citizens.

The governer of the city will act as a platform for the service companies to serve people. The governor will maintain the infrastructure and regulate the service companies to make sure they can ensure their services and not risk lives.

 - Governor - the governor provides the infrastructure and a service platform for the services
 - Service companies - service companies provide paid services to city residents
 - Residents - the residents pay tax to the governor and consume the services from service companies

The platform of services is a key component of the city design.

The service platform will start small with the foundation of the city and will grow with it. It will also influence the three milestones.

```
Diagram with the raodmap of the service platform along the milestones
 - the diagram shows when the three key characteristics develop
```

When the city is founded, the governer will be hiring the companies and staff accomodating the scientists and tourists. It will also hire service companies to provide the minimal set of services to support life in the city.

Already at this point the governor will provide the **common infrastructure** to support delivery of those services. The governor will also **regulate the sevices** to ensure residents receive adequate life support and that relevant risks with disruption and health are mitigated. The service platform will have developed two of its three key characterstics but will still be small and funded by the governor.

When the city passes **Milestone 1** the service platform will need to expand to support more than 1 thousand residents. It will add its third key characteristic - a marketplace for services. The platform will continue providing the common infrastructure and regulation over services and will now also be driven by competition based on the free market forces of supply and demand. At this point it will be common for more than one service company to provide the same or similar services, since they are now attracted by the market and not hired by the governor.

```
 - value exchange
 - finance of each role
```

## Minimum set of services

The minimum set of services cover the biological and physiological needs of the residents. The governor ensures there is sufficient supply for all residents. The governor regulates the services to ensure they are accessible, safe and guarantied.

- shelter
- air - recycling of imported and locally produced air
- food - storage of imported dried food; local fresh produce in vertical farms
- water - storage of local water; recycling
- heating - electricity or air conditioning
- waste management
- electricity - nuclear, solar, ... ensures the infrastructure is running and ensures connection to the control center
- communication - ensures connection to the control center (AI) and the rest of the world

## Amenities

Higher level needs can also be covered through the same service platform. The governor will not necessarily enforce regulation on those.

- security
- education - schools
- health - hospitals
- entertainment - cinemas, theaters, restaurants
- leisure - parks
- travel
- shopping - malls

## Aspects of life - social, political, culture, ...

By coveing the lower level needs of the residents, the service platform frees room for higher aspects of life to develop in a natural way. They will use their free time to socialize, for culture, for parenting, for hobbies, for business, etc.

All aspects of life will still be well connected to those on the Earth. For example, with service providers of Internet on Mars that solve network latency by mirroring content locally, residents on Mars will be able to enjoy the same TV shows, sports events, etc. that their friends from Earth enjoy.

Some aspects of life may, however, have more specific development on Mars. For example, with the high degree of automation and artificial intelligence of the service platform and the infrastructure, there may be no taxes for business activity (like VAT on the Earth) and the economy on Mars may become far more fluid than that on Earth.

# Modular infrastruture

An important part of the city design is the modular infrastructure consisting of connected modules as floor and logisticts, rammed soil cover, maintenance drones and the control center that are the physicals support of the service platform.

## Modules

There are modules made of metal that are laid on the ground and connected to each other. These modules give the floor of all spaces in the city - private, social and industrial. The modules are standardized and therefore they can be repurposed, reused and replaced as needed.

The basic module is a hollow hexagonal prism of 2 meters in side length and 0.6 meters in height. It has two layers.

The lower layer is for transporation. It contains 3 tubes connecting its opposite sides with an electro-mechanical dispatcher unit that controls the movement of capsules in the tubes. The dispather unit will maintain the speed of the capsules in transit through the module, will pull the capsules that are sent to this module out of the transport tubes and will store them in the upper layer, and will put the capsules that are sent from this module into the transport tubes.

The upper layer serves as a storage for resources and as a highly protected environment. The capsules that are stored in the upper layer of the module can be used by appliances placed on the module, or can be just stored for future use.

The highly protected environment of the upper layer is also used by residents as a healthy place to sleep in, and as an emergency safe place. This layer can be equipped with instruments for health monitoring and treatment.

```

```

The module is connected to other modules tiling in a honecomb structure. The tubes of adjacent modules get connected to form long pipes for transportation of goods in the capsules.

## Capsules

```

## Cover

The entire city is covered with a structure made of bricks of rammed soil.

```
Diagram of a cover
```

The cover provides a first-level protection from radiation and bad weather. Second-level protection is the module inflatable and the third-level (emergency) protection is the module cabine.

The air pressure and temperature in the cover are not sufficient for humans without extra protection but allow for short-time activities outside the modules

The habitat should be good from phychological point of view. Therefore it should provide sufficient space and light. Artificial light sources are attached to the bottom side of the cover to replace sunlight. The structure allows for a few hundred meters range of sight. Colored sculptures imitate trees in the distance.

```
Image of the interior of the cover
It shows:
 - the tiles of modules
 - the columns of the covers such that you can see in the distance
 - artificial light
 - tree structures
```

The cover is made by drones.

## Drones

Maintenance drones are designed to be simple and cheap. They are most effective and efficient when swarming. They are controlled centrally.

A single drone is configured to perform at least one of the following activities:
 * collect soil
 * ram soil into a brick
 * move a brick of rammed soil
 * move a module (together with other drones)

```

Conclusion for how many drones and how much time is necessary to build housings for 1 thousand residents
```

## Control

All infrastructure components are controlled centrally by AI. The control center manages the transactions in the service platform, optimizes the path of deliveries, mitigates risks of failures, builds new housings, repairs existing housings, conditions living spaces and assists the residents.

The control center also serves as the main interface in communication between the residents, the businesses, the governor, the service platform. For example, when a resident wants to report an incident they will talk to the AI.
