The following is a design of an envisioned city on Mars. It describes a pioneering large settlement in space - one that should be possible to build already in 21st century. Its design focuses on characteristics that will make it practical, vital and sustainable. As such, the design of this city will greatly differ from possible designs of future cities created after mankind has well established its presence in space.

The design of the city is based on four key characteristics:
 * **Economic attractiveness** - while the Earth in 21st century is seeing the limit to its population and fierce competition over natural resources, the city on Mars will offer businesses healthy economic growth through access to **fast-growing population** and **untapped resources**
 * **Development roadmap** - the **identity of the city** will evolve around a sequence of **important milestones** in its development - building the first space elevator and the first industrial factory in space - attracting the right residents to support it
 * **Service platform** - the city will provide a platform for services for the needs of its residents and businesses. It will make it easy for businesses to start their operations and **scale fast**. It will also ensure all services are **safe for the residents**
 * **Modular infrastructure** - the infrastructure provides basis for the logistics in the city through an assembly of **standardized blocks**. The blocks are easy to replace when damaged and easy to relocate when the city needs to **adapt and evolve**

```
Summary of the city design instead of design principles:
- economics of the city - three roles: governor providing infrastructure and service platform, service companies providing services and the residents/citizens
- three phases that fuel growth with unique attractiveness
- life support - with minimum set of services
- politics, culture, economy, ... - participates in the "global" (now interplanetary) system but will quickly build own style and add to diversity of human civilization. Large set of services. Good standard of living. It will become a great place to live in
```

# Economic attractiveness

```
projections for World population growth 2000-2100
projections for World GDP per capita
note on population growth as key driver for economic growth
note on competition in saturated markets
note on utilization of natural resources (e.g. polution, fresh water) and how it affects economy and living standards
projections for Mars City population growth
note on reversed economic development of the city - knowledge -> service -> manufacturing -> extraction - thus GDP will start high
conclusion that Mars City will have steady economic growth that will attract governor and businesses
```

# Development roadmap
The design of the city follows a roadmap of three key milestones and the interaction of three key participating groups:

![figure-roadmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/77237552-fa4e6500-6bd1-11ea-84c4-7a082a0c2048.png)

## 2030: City founded
The city is founded in around 2030 with the infrastructure and staff to support scientists and tourists

![milestone-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925239-c18bd900-8d96-11ea-809f-1862df0036ea.png)

The city will gradually attract more scientists and tourists and re-invest the income in scaling the infrastructure and staff, with 8:2 ratio of staff to scientists/tourists, until it reaches population of 1 thousand

## 2050: First Space elevator
The city will build its first space elevator in around 2050.

![milestone-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925241-c2bd0600-8d96-11ea-8f41-4438bb606af3.png)

The elevator will be in its own right a "wonder of the world" with great economic and social impact. It will mark a turning point for the city by offering more affordable way for people to maintain their desired standard of living on Mars as compared to the Earth. The number of people self-funding their migration to the city will for the first time exceed the number of residents hired to support the scientists and tourists

## 2100: First industrial factory in space
The city will build its first industrial factory in space in around 2100.

![milestone-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925235-bd5fbb80-8d96-11ea-87cb-a1a8ce36ce03.png)

The factory will have strong competitive advantages over the industrial sites on the Earth in producing certain products by exploiting the vacuum of space, zero gravity, less risk of polution.

## 2150: Population of 1 million
The city will maintain average yearly growth of 4-5% to reach a population of 1 million by around 2150.

![milestone-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925238-bfc21580-8d96-11ea-9972-8bed55533ed6.png)

# Service platform

The city growth is driven by the interaction of three groups:

```
diagram of Governor, Service companies, Residents
```

 - Governor - the governor provides the infrastructure and a service platform for the services
 - Service companies - service companies provide paid services to city residents
 - Residents - the residents pay tax to the governor and consume the services from service companies

The platform of services is a key component of the city design.

The service platform will start small with the foundation of the city and will grow with it. It will also influence the three milestones.

```

 - the diagram shows when the three key characteristics develop
```

When the city is founded, the governer will be hiring the companies and staff accomodating the scientists and tourists. It will also hire service companies to provide the minimal set of services to support life in the city.

Already at this point the governor will provide the **common infrastructure** to support delivery of those services. The governor will also **regulate the sevices** to ensure residents receive adequate life support and that relevant risks with disruption and health are mitigated. The service platform will have developed two of its three key characterstics but will still be small and funded by the governor.

When the city passes **Milestone 1** the service platform will need to expand to support more than 1 thousand residents. It will add its third key characteristic - a marketplace for services. The platform will continue providing the common infrastructure and regulation over services and will now also be driven by competition based on the free market forces of supply and demand. At this point it will be common for more than one service company to provide the same or similar services, since they are now attracted by the market and not hired by the governor.

# Basics

```
 - infrastructure
 - service platform - standartization and regulation
 - minimum set of services
 - this set scales with growth
```

A government or private entity will found the city. People will then move into the city to live and work in. Service companies will also move into the city to continue developing it.

This section describes the city design

Building blocks of infrastructure, private spaces and social spaces

- living space
- protection from radiation
- sunlight

## Minimum set of services

- air conditioning
- water
- heating
- food
- waste management

# Growth

The city will go through three phases with respect to its economy development:
1. Science and tourism - The short-term phase in which the population is between 10 and 1 thousand. The city will develop unique opportunities for scientists and tourists to support its growth
2. Real-estate - The mid-term phase in which the polulation grows from 1 thousand to 100 thousand. The city will develop unique niche of standard of living to attract people and support its growth
3. Industrial - The long-term phase in which the population will grow from 100 thousand to 1 million. The city will build the first industrial zone in space to support its growth through exports

## Science and tourism phase
Years: from 2030 to 2050
Population: from 10 to 1000
Growth: 20%
Attractiveness: paying scientists and tourists

Governor founds the city with initial investment. Investment costs projections. ROI

## Real-estate phase
Years: from 2050 to 2100
Population: from 1K to 100K
Population growth rate: 10%
Attractiveness: Unique niche for standard of living for cost of living

Why attractive to investors and loaners?
![World population growth 1700-2100](figure-world-population-growth-1700-2100.png)

Why attractive to new citizens?
Certain people will find it cheaper to maintain their desired standard of life on Mars rather than on Earth because of over-population issues. They will be able to move in on a basic mortgage.
Cost projections for citizens.

Diagram:
 - Citizens pays Governor for housing. Governor gives regulation of services.
 - Service companies give services to citizens. Service companies receive subscription fees from citizens.
 - Service companies give tax to governor. Governor gives service platform and access to citizens.

The governer of the city will act as a platform for the service companies to serve people. The governor will maintain the infrastructure and regulate the service companies to make sure they can ensure their services and not risk lives.

Minimum set of services

## Industrial phase
Years: from 2100 to 2150
Population: from 100K to 1M
Population growth rate: 5%
Attractiveness: Prospering industrial zone

At this point the city will have advantage over the Earth in building a large industrial complex in space. This industrial complex will have unique possibilities for supporting special technologies and developing economies. For example, it will have easier access to asteroid-mined resources, will be able to use technologies relying on zero-gravity or vacuum, will be less exposed to risks of polution, etc.
The city will use its space elevator to build the complex at a lower cost for transportation and construction as compared to Earth competition. The complex will be robotized and controlled from Mars surface.
