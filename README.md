The following is a design of an envisioned city on Mars. It describes a pioneering large settlement in space - one that should be possible to build already in 21st century. Its design focuses on characteristics that will make it practical, vital and sustainable. As such, the design of this city will greatly differ from possible designs of future cities created after mankind has well established its presence in space.

The design of the city is based on four key characteristics:
 * **Economic attractiveness** - while the Earth in 21st century is seeing the limit to its population and fierce competition over natural resources, the city on Mars will offer businesses healthy economic growth through access to **fast-growing population** and **untapped resources**
 * **Development roadmap** - the **identity of the city** will evolve around a sequence of **major milestones** in its development - building the first space elevator and the first industrial factory in space - attracting the right residents to support it
 * **Service platform** - the city will provide a platform for services for the needs of its residents and businesses. It will make it easy for businesses to quickly start and **scale** their operations. It will also enforce **regulation** over all services to ensure they are safe to be consumed by the residents
 * **Modular infrastructure** - the infrastructure provides basis for the logistics in the city through an assembly of **standardized blocks**. The blocks are easy to replace when damaged and easy to relocate when the city needs to **adapt and evolve**

and the interaction of three key participating groups:
 * **Governor**
 * **Residents**
 * **Service companies**

# Economic attractiveness

```
Section #2
note on reversed economic development of the city - knowledge -> service -> manufacturing -> extraction - thus GDP will start high
conclusion that Mars City will have steady economic growth that will attract governor and businesses

# Development roadmap
The design of the city follows a roadmap of four major milestones:


The city will go through three phases with respect to its economy development:
1. Science and tourism - The short-term phase in which the population is between 10 and 1 thousand. The city will develop unique opportunities for scientists and tourists to support its growth
2. Real-estate - The mid-term phase in which the polulation grows from 1 thousand to 100 thousand. The city will develop unique niche of standard of living to attract people and support its growth
3. Industrial - The long-term phase in which the population will grow from 100 thousand to 1 million. The city will build the first industrial zone in space to support its growth through exports

```
- economics of the city - three roles: governor providing infrastructure and service platform, service companies providing services and the residents/citizens
- three phases that fuel growth with unique attractiveness
```

## 2030: City founded
The city is founded in around 2030 with the infrastructure and staff to support scientists and tourists

![milestone-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925239-c18bd900-8d96-11ea-809f-1862df0036ea.png)

The city will gradually attract more scientists and tourists and re-invest the income in scaling the infrastructure and staff, with 8:2 ratio of staff to scientists/tourists, until it reaches population of 1 thousand

```
Science and tourism phase
Years: from 2030 to 2050
Population: from 10 to 1000
Growth: 20%
Attractiveness: paying scientists and tourists

```

## 2050: First Space elevator
The city will build its first space elevator in around 2050.

![milestone-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925241-c2bd0600-8d96-11ea-8f41-4438bb606af3.png)

The elevator will be in its own right a "wonder of the world" with great economic and social impact. It will mark a turning point for the city by offering more affordable way for people to maintain their desired standard of living on Mars as compared to the Earth. The number of people self-funding their migration to the city will for the first time exceed the number of residents hired to support the scientists and tourists

```
Real-estate phase
Years: from 2050 to 2100
Population: from 1K to 100K
Population growth rate: 10%
Attractiveness: Unique niche for standard of living for cost of living

Why attractive to new citizens?
Certain people will find it cheaper to maintain their desired standard of life on Mars rather than on Earth because of over-population issues. They will be able to move in on a basic mortgage.
Cost projections for citizens.
```

## 2100: First industrial factory in space
The city will build its first industrial factory in space in around 2100.

![milestone-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925235-bd5fbb80-8d96-11ea-87cb-a1a8ce36ce03.png)

The factory will have strong competitive advantages over the industrial sites on the Earth in producing certain products by exploiting the vacuum of space, zero gravity, less risk of polution.

```
Industrial phase
Years: from 2100 to 2150
Population: from 100K to 1M
Population growth rate: 5%
Attractiveness: Prospering industrial zone

The role of governor, citizens, service companies. The point of view of governor, citizens, service companies

At this point the city will have advantage over the Earth in building a large industrial complex in space. This industrial complex will have unique possibilities for supporting special technologies and developing economies. For example, it will have easier access to asteroid-mined resources, will be able to use technologies relying on zero-gravity or vacuum, will be less exposed to risks of polution, etc.
The city will use its space elevator to build the complex at a lower cost for transportation and construction as compared to Earth competition. The complex will be robotized and controlled from Mars surface.
```

## 2150: Population of 1 million
The city will maintain average yearly growth of 4-5% to reach a population of 1 million by around 2150.

![milestone-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/637315/80925238-bfc21580-8d96-11ea-9972-8bed55533ed6.png)

# Service platform

The city growth is driven by the interaction of three groups:

```
diagram of Governor, Service companies, Residents
- life support - with minimum set of services
- politics, culture, economy, ... - participates in the "global" (now interplanetary) system but will quickly build own style and add to diversity of human civilization. Large set of services. Good standard of living. It will become a great place to live in
```

A government or private entity will found the city. People will then move into the city to live and work in. Service companies will also move into the city to continue developing it.

Diagram:
 - Citizens pays Governor for housing. Governor gives regulation of services.
 - Service companies give services to citizens. Service companies receive subscription fees from citizens.
 - Service companies give tax to governor. Governor gives service platform and access to citizens.

The governer of the city will act as a platform for the service companies to serve people. The governor will maintain the infrastructure and regulate the service companies to make sure they can ensure their services and not risk lives.

 - Governor - the governor provides the infrastructure and a service platform for the services
 - Service companies - service companies provide paid services to city residents
 - Residents - the residents pay tax to the governor and consume the services from service companies

The platform of services is a key component of the city design.

The service platform will start small with the foundation of the city and will grow with it. It will also influence the three milestones.

```
Diagram with the raodmap of the service platform along the milestones
 - the diagram shows when the three key characteristics develop
```

When the city is founded, the governer will be hiring the companies and staff accomodating the scientists and tourists. It will also hire service companies to provide the minimal set of services to support life in the city.

Already at this point the governor will provide the **common infrastructure** to support delivery of those services. The governor will also **regulate the sevices** to ensure residents receive adequate life support and that relevant risks with disruption and health are mitigated. The service platform will have developed two of its three key characterstics but will still be small and funded by the governor.

When the city passes **Milestone 1** the service platform will need to expand to support more than 1 thousand residents. It will add its third key characteristic - a marketplace for services. The platform will continue providing the common infrastructure and regulation over services and will now also be driven by competition based on the free market forces of supply and demand. At this point it will be common for more than one service company to provide the same or similar services, since they are now attracted by the market and not hired by the governor.

```
 - value exchange
 - finance of each role
```

## Minimum set of services

- air conditioning
- water
- heating
- food
- waste management

## Amenities

- schools
- shopping malls
- theaters
- restaurants
- parks
- travel

# Modular infrastruture

An important part of the city design is the modular infrastructure consisting of connected modules as floor and logisticts, rammed soil cover, maintenance drones and the control center that are the physicals support of the service platform.

## Modules

There are modules made of metal that are laid on the ground and connected to each other. These modules give the floor of all spaces in the city - private, social and industrial. The modules are standardized and therefore they can be repurposed, reused and replaced as needed.

The basic module is a hollow hexagonal prism of 2 meters in side length and 0.6 meters in height. It contains 3 tubes connecting its opposite sides with a electro-mechanical unit that controls the movement of capsules in the tubes.

```

```

The module is connected to other modules tiling in a honecomb structure. The tubes of adjacent modules get connected to form long pipes for transportation of goods in the capsules.

```

```

## Capsules

```

```

## Cover

The entire city is covered with a structure made of bricks of rammed soil.

```
Diagram of a cover
```

The cover provides a first-level protection from radiation and bad weather. Second-level protection is the module inflatable and the third-level (emergency) protection is the module cabine.

The air pressure and temperature in the cover are not sufficient for humans without extra protection but allow for short-time activities outside the modules

Artificial light sources are attached to the bottom side of the cover to replace sunlight. People need sunlight psychologically.

## Drones

Maintenance drones are designed to be simple and cheap. They are most effective and efficient when swarming. They are controlled centrally.

A single drone is configured to perform at least one of the following activities:
 * collect soil
 * ram soil into a brick
 * move a brick of rammed soil
 * move a module (together with other drones)

```

```

## Control

All infrastructure components are controlled centrally by AI. The control center manages the transactions in the service platform, optimizes the path of deliveries, mitigates risks of failures, builds new housings, repairs existing housings, conditions living spaces and assists the residents.

```
