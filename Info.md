* Summary

  - practical, vital and sustainable

  * 4 characteristics
    * Economic attractiveness - economic growth through fast-growing population and untapped resources
    * Development roadmap - sequence of major milestones defining the identity of the city
    * Service platform - helps businesses start and scale; ensures safety for residents
    * Modular infrastructure - ensures scaling, maintenance and adaptation using standardized modules
  * 3 players
    * Governor
    * Residents
    * Businesses
  * 4 milestones
    * City founded
    * First space elevator
    * First industrial factory in space
  * 3 phases
    * Science and tourism
    * Real-estate
    * Industrial

* Economic attractiveness

  * Natural resources and population growth on the Earth
    * Economic growth is defined by competition in saturated markets
    * World GDP per capita - continues to increase but requires more investment
    * Utilization of natural resources - reaching limits (polution, fresh water) - hindering economic growth
    * Population growth is a key driver for economic growth
    * World population growth - also reaches a limit
    * Conclusion: economic growth is more and more expensive to keep up on the Earth

  * Natural resources and population growth on Mars
    * Projections for population growth of Mars City
    * Access to natural resources on Mars - Mars planet, smaller gravity well and access to asteroid belt
    * Conclusion: Mars will be attractive as a destination for economic growth

  * Economic development of a city on Mars
    * Reversed: knowledge -> service -> manufacturing -> extraction
    * GDP will start high
    * Conclusion: steady economic growth that will attract governor and businesses

* Development roadmap

  * 2030: City founded. Science and tourism phase
    * years: 2030 - 2050
    * livelihood: science and tourism
    * Governor hires businesses and individuals and this is how it gets residents
    * Governor builds service platform with few participating businesses
    * population growth: 20% per year - follows the growth of Governors science and tourism projects
    * population: 10 -> 1K
    * milestone: Create first space elevator

  * 2050: First space elevator. Real-estate phase
    * years: 2050 - 2100
    * livelihood: real estate and services
    * Residents can self-fund to Mars (bank credit). They are attracted by the economic attractiveness and possibilities to raise children and enjoy high living standard
    * Governor opens service platform to many businesses
    * population growth: 10% per year - follows the growth of markets
    * population: 1K -> 100K
    * milestone: Create first industrial factory in space - advantage over the Earth in building a large industrial complex in space. The city will use its space elevator to build the complex at a lower cost for transportation and construction as compared to Earth competition. The complex will be robotized and controlled from Mars surface.

  * 2100: First industrial factory in space. Industrial phase
    * years: 2100 - 2150
    * livelihood: prospering industrial zone
    * Unique advantages for special technologies and economies - asteroid-mined resources, zero-gravity, vacuum, reduced risks of polution, etc.
    * population growth: 5% per year - the growth of a developed society
    * milestone: population of 1 million

  * 2150: Population of 1 million
    * Developed society
    * Extends humans civilization
    * High living standard
    * Still attractive for economic growth
    * Aspects of life - social, political, culture, ...

* Service platform
